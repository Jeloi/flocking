Flocking in Noise
=================

A loose implementation of flocking behavior based off of Craig Reynolds' "boids" model, with boid's moving in a noise flow field. Created in Processing.

Primary forces at work are:
Cohesion - agents tend towards center of mass of neighbors
Centering - agents tend towards center of mass of all particles. Force weighted varies with a cosine function.
Noise - a moving 3D noise field acts to exert a force on agents
